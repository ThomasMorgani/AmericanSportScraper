Players: 
    for now will have 2 ids ?
    internal: name + team + pos hashed, this is to have a unique key in the backend until we propogate all official ids
    id: from nfl.com... cant find ids for rookies due to no game data exisiting yet
        hopefully once the seaoson starts should get ids for all players eventually
