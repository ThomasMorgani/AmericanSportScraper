Players: 
    for now will have 2 ids ?
    internal: name + team + pos hashed, this is to have a unique key in the backend until we propogate all official ids
    id: from nfl.com... cant find ids for rookies due to no game data exisiting yet
        hopefully once the seaoson starts should get ids for all players eventually


GameDataWeek:
    Sometimes page times out or certain data is not
    loaded/missed

    figure out how to handle missing data
    OPTIONS:
        -ignore and assume subsequent scrapes will eventually get it (which has been the case)
        -check if data is missing and push game slug back onto array
            -or better new array of missing games and try those at end if length > 0 (avoids endless loop)
